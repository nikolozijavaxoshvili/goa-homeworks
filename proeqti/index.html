  <h4>What is front-end development?
    Front-end development refers to creating and maintaining the part of the website with which end users interact. That includes the font of the text, the colors of the page and the styles of the menus and links visible on the screen. Front-end developers not only establish the overall look of a site but also create its interface and user experience. In carrying out this directive, they also perform a variety of additional tasks, such as:
    Developing an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface
    Improving the user interface based on user feedback
    Optimizing the user experience, resolving issues of design or functionality that may hinder navigation
    Optimizing a website to function properly across device types and browsers
    Creating concepts and using tools to materialize them
    Helping to organize and manage the software workflow
    Testing a website's front end for ease of use and potential errors
    Applying search engine optimization (SEO) principles to ensure appropriate indexing of the website by search engines 
    The technical skills of front-end developers largely revolve around programming languages like HTML, JavaScript and CSS. These tools are essential for creating the layout of a website and adding various visual elements to improve both functionality and aesthetic quality. Essential soft skills of the role include collaboration and teamwork, as front-end developers typically work closely with others—web designers, user experience ( UX) analysts and back-end developers—to ensure they're meeting specifications.

    What is full-stack development?
    Full-stack development is a combination of back-end and front-end development. Generally, full-stack developers can perform all front-end and back-end programming tasks with little or no assistance. That includes responsibilities involving servers, databases, user experience, hosting, data modeling and other duties that go into establishing a functional, visually appealing website. Some of the specific tasks that full-stack developers perform include:
    Helping the software design and development teams
    Optimizing software through constant testing and debugging
    Writing code for both the front and back end of a software application
    Making sure that a website runs on multiple platforms
    Designing a web application's user interactions
    Working on the back end of the software, implementing servers and databases
    Working with graphic designers to create and implement new features
    Keeping software up to date with the latest industry developments
    Communicating with the hiring company's decision-makers
    Resolving issues relating to maintenance, security and scalability
    Because full-stack development incorporates the front and the back ends of web development, a broader range of technical proficiency is necessary to excel in the position. That includes both the server-side and the user-side programming languages, along with soft skills such as communication, teamwork, collaboration and leadership. </h4></div></center>

      <center> <h1>back-end </h1>   <h6>The back-end is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests from the clients, and contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. The back-end also includes the database, which will persistently store all of the data for the application There are several reasons why a back end is required for a website to function properly.

        Validates and exchanges information such as login IDs and passwords: Everyone needs to provide their login information to access a website's user interface. The back end verifies the user's provided login information and password. The back end code also saves any information the user submits to the databases.
        
        Customizes your product for multiple environments: Companies now set up websites and other internet features in many environments. For example, some businesses run their websites on internet servers, while others prefer to put internet operations in the cloud.
        
        Adds utility to front end functionality: Programmers need to create back end code as part of the website development process to make each front end capability more useful. For instance, to make a user login form function, they must write code in a server-side programming language. The back end script will gather the values each time a user submits his login information and compare them to the stored information in databases.
        
        Improves the user experience: The back end of a website is where all work necessary to make it work occurs. So, the quality of the back end code will affect the user experience provided by a website. Any back-end programming flaws might cause a website to often crash, operate slowly, or have other performance problems.
        
        How do you create a back end on a website?
        In order to create a back end on a website, you need a good understanding of the basic algorithms and structures used in back end development.
        
        Since the back end focuses on creating the code to make a website work properly, you will need to choose a coding language:
        
        Object-oriented: Java, Python, .NET
        
        Functional: R, F#, SQL
        
        The next step is to learn about the frameworks and databases you wish to utilize and choose which one best fits what you want to do with your project.
        
        Although you will deal with the back end, it’s important to understand how the front end works. Make sure you have a good grip on app scaling, database management, and hosting environment. You might also need to build one or more web architectures and configure operating systems, DevOps, and payment systems.</h6></center>
